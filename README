xf86-video-armada
X.org graphics driver for KMS based systems with pluggable GPU backend

What is xf86-video-armada?
--------------------------
The xf86-video-armada module is a 2D graphics driver for the X Window
System as implemented by X.org, supporting these DRM KMS drivers:

	Freescale i.MX
	Marvell Armada 510 (Dove)

and GPUs:

	Vivnate libGAL (Armada only)
	Etnaviv (Armada and i.MX) with galcore kernel driver

Build requirements
------------------
xf86-video-armada can be built as a stand-alone KMS driver, or with
Vivante and/or Etnaviv GPU support.

When building with Vivante libGAL support, the configure options
--with-libgal-include= and --with-libgal-lib= should indicate the
location of the libGAL headers and library respectively.

When building Etnaviv support, the configure options
--with-etnaviv-include= and --with-etnaviv-lib= should indicate the
location of the etnaviv headers and library respectively.
Alternatively, --with-etnaviv-source= can be used to indicate the
location of the built Etnaviv tree.

The following packages are required by this driver:

- libdrm-armada   git://ftp.arm.linux.org.uk/~rmk/libdrm-armada.git/

The following packages are optional, but may be required for certain
features:

- etnaviv         https://github.com/laanwj/etna_viv.git

What operations are accelerated?
--------------------------------
- Copies using all alu operations.
- GetImage partially accelerated.
- PutImage partially accelerated.
- Solid fills without stipples or partial plane mask.
- FillSpans without stipples or partial plane mask.
- Xrender compositing without alpha maps, and for PE1.0 hardware, without
  component alpha.
- Xrender glyph caching, and rendering of glyphs - etnaviv only.
